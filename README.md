# Hello, I'm Yashvi!

I'm a data enthusiast by nature, computer engineer by practice and a part-time artist (in my head haha). I'm recently completed my masters from Carnegie Mellon University. I have a passion for solving real time business challenge using data. And when I am not surrounded by data, I am doodling and posting them on my channel. You can see my work below. I aspire to be a data scientist in the future. :')
